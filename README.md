Cyber Rakshak - Interactive Cyber Crime Awareness & Prevention Guide
Cyber Rakshak is an interactive guide for cybercrime awareness and prevention, designed to educate and protect individuals of all ages from online threats. The project was developed by the team "Digital Defenders" from CSJM University, Kanpur, for the "Hack Beyond Limits Online Odyssey" event. It falls under the Cybersecurity / Social Impact track.





The project addresses the rapid increase in cybercrime incidents and the lack of accessible, engaging, and age-appropriate resources. Many people fall victim to common scams like WhatsApp frauds, phishing emails, and payment scams due to a lack of awareness. Cyber Rakshak aims to solve this by providing an interactive and user-friendly platform that combines educational content with gamified learning.





Features

Age-Specific Content: The platform provides content tailored for various age groups, including students (Class 1-12), college students (UG & PG), working professionals, and homemakers.



Interactive Learning: It uses a gamified approach to make learning about cyber safety fun and memorable.



Scenario-Based Quizzes: Users can test their knowledge with quizzes based on real-life scenarios, which provide safety tips and points for correct answers.


Comprehensive Articles: The guide includes simple articles on various scams, such as WhatsApp fraud, payment scams, email spoofing, and phishing.


Real-time Alerts: The platform integrates a News API to provide the latest cybercrime news and alerts.



Multi-lingual Support: It currently supports Hindi and English, with future plans to include more regional languages.


Offline Mode: A planned feature includes an offline mode for users in areas with poor internet connectivity.


Voice-based Guidance: Future updates will include voice-based guidance to assist non-readers.

Technology Stack
The project's technology stack is designed to create a responsive, interactive, and efficient platform.



Frontend: React.js is used for building the user interface and interactive elements.


Backend: Node.js and Express.js handle the backend logic, including the quiz system, point allocation, and progress tracking.



Database: MongoDB is used to store user progress and scores.
